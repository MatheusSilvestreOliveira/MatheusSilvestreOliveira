- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MatheusSilvestreOliveira
- I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil and I have a degree in Computer Science from Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie (M)
- I use GitHub to post my studies and keep my codes organized, when I can haha ;)
- What I like the most about coding is finding a solution for a problem, sometimes it's easy and quick, but it can also be so hard and at the same time so rewarding when you manage to crack it.
- I'm interested in learning more about cybersecurity, I don't know anything about it, but I like the concept of it, keeping people and our data safe from malicious attacks.
- I'm currently learning Unity 2D and Unreal Engine 4, I like playing games, maybe I can also make them, who knows... ;)

- Let's code....
